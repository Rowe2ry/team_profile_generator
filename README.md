  ## Description  

  

  A command line application that can write and style a page for your engineering team.  

  * Motivation  

    To challenge myself to generate dynamic HTML files form a command line application.  

  * Reason for Building  

    I wanted a tool that could display user information in a useful and responsive layout.  

  * Problems Solved  

    Having to style and code a page for a dev team.  

  * Things Learned  

    I learned about using various arrays in the inquirer npm to generate a "main menu" and sub menus in a command line aplication. I learned how to write both HTML and CSS files in node. And I learned how to write and impliment jest tests for making the JS modules bulletproof.

  ## Usage  

  [Video Demo/Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ioTmxm6yMS4mar0iMBF8-RSHj7R87CRw/view)

  Once the application is running, use arrow keys to select what you want to do. You can start bulding the team, change the page appearance, and finally, generate a page. Start the new project by adding a team manager, then add as many or as few other team members as you like. Select a dark or light mode, and an accent color.
