# README_generator

  ## Description  

  

  A command line application used to generate a professional README file.  

  * Motivation  

    Every developer needs a readme with any project they build. I wanted to make a tool that would streamline the process of making one.  

  * Reason for Building  

    To not only have access to the tool itself, but to write my first full-fledged command line program.  

  * Problems Solved  

    It walks developers through the otherwise mundane process of making their readme files.  

  * Things Learned  

    I learned how to modularize javascript files to work together for one greater function.
